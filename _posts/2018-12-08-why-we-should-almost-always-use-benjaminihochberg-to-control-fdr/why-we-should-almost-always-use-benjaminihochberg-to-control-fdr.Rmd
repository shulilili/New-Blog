## Tukey's test 
When people have multiple groups and have no prior hypothesis about which specific groups might differ, people usually use Tukey's test as a post hoc test that test all possible group comparisons. 


x <- factor(rep(LETTERS[1:6],rep(4,6)))

p_matrix = matrix(NA, 1000, 15)
for(i in 1:1000){
  ps = as.numeric(pairwise.t.test(rnorm(24),x,p.adjust.method='none')$p.value)
  ps = ps[!is.na(ps)]
  p_matrix[i,] = ps
}
